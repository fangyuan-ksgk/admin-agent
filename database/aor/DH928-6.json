DC962 -17/22  dated 4 Mar 2024 , \u201cCMDS -Lite for Frigate \u201d. Approved by HD OLG, \nNELD  on 16 Mar 2023 .  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \n1. Quartermasters (QMs) handle a wide spectrum of important tasks from \ntracking attendance and whereabouts of personnel, contractors, and visitors to \nflying flags and making announcements to ensuring safety onboard ship, amongst \nothers. Tracking of attendance for a crew of between 70 to 90 is a tedious task, \nand QMs are also responsib le for keeping track of contractors and visitors as they \ncome onboard for works throughout the day. If tracking of attendance for ship \ncrew and visitors can be completely automated, this will free up cognitive \nworkload for the QMs to focus on other tasks t hat cannot yet be automated (eg. \nflying of flags). A secure mobile digital platform known as the Crew Mobile \nDigital Services (CMDS) has previously been implemented on the RSN\u2019s Littoral \nMission Vessels (LMVs) . \n \nAIM  \n \n2. This paper seeks HD DO \u2019s approval for the requirement specifications  for \nthe trial of the CMDS -Lite for two Frigates ( FFSes ).  \n \n \n \n OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  \n2 \nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)  SCOPE OF WORK  AND CONTRACT VALUE  \n \n3. Scope . The scope  will include  the hardware, software and support required \nfor the Proof of Concept (PoC) trial of the CMDS -Lite on two FFSes .  \n \n4. Contract Value .  The estimated contract value of this trial will not exceed  \n$124,000  (see the breakdown in Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Cost Breakdown  \nS/N Description  Estimated Cost  \n1 Hardware for 2 FFSes  $36,000 \n2 Software and Licenses for 2 FFSes  $10,000 \n3 IT man -effort and Professional Services  $78,000 \nTotal  $124,000  \n \n5. Contract Duration . Contractor has up to 3 months to complete \ndevelopment, supply, installation, after which trial  duration is for 30 days . After \nthe trial, the findings will be evaluated through a report within 1 month before \nrelevant RSN  stakeholders decide if the re is value to expand this to other  ships . \n  \n6. Option for Scale -Up. The Supplier shall provide an option for proliferation \nshould the PoC be successful in the form of supply and commission of additional \nship-sets of CMDS -Lite. The scale up was shaped on a per ship basis with \nassumption of similar scale. The option shall be valid for 1 year  after submission \nand acceptance of trial report . Each ship\u2019s installation shall be completed within \n3 months of PO.  Maintenance on a per -ship basis shall also be quoted  (starting \nafter warranty expiry) . \n \nEVALUATION METHODOLOGY  \n \n7. Evaluation will be based on the Contractor\u2019s ability to comply with the \ntechnical  requirements stated in the requirement specifications and price \nreasonableness in comparison with existing market rates and past purchase \nprices.  Quality (including innovatio n components) is not considered as the \nevaluation  criteria  as the nature of these buys is such that the quality is not \ndifferentiable and price is the primary consideration . \n \n \n \n OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  \n3 \nOFFICIAL (CLOSED)  RECOMMENDATION  \n \n8. It is recommended that HD DO  approves t he requirement specifications \nand evaluation methodology  for the PoC trial of the CMDS -Lite on two FFSes .  \n \n \n \nME4 Ng Teng Ooi  \nSenior Combat System Engineer, RSS Steadfast  \n \nConsulted  : ME6 Tang Chee Meng, Hd EDB, WARCEN  \nME5 Derrick Wong, SCSE, First Flotilla  \nME4 Ang Kar Choon, Senior Engineer, WARCEN  \n \nAnnexes:  \nA.
