DC888-11/22 dated 4 Jan 2024, \u201cXXX-XXXX-XXX\u201d. Approved by HD XX, YYY on 16 Mar 2023.     BACKGROUND    1. Quartermasters (QMs) handle a wide spectrum of important tasks from tracking attendance and whereabouts of personnel, contractors, and visitors to flying flags and making announcements to ensuring safety onboard ship, amongst others. Tracking of attendance for a crew of between 70 to 90 is a tedious task, and QMs are also responsible for keeping track of contractors and visitors as they come onboard for works throughout the day. If tracking of attendance for ship crew and visitors can be completely automated, this will free up cognitive workload for the QMs to focus on other tasks that cannot yet be automated (eg. flying of flags). A secure mobile digital platform known as the Mighty Mobile Master Manager (MMMM) has previously been implemented.    AIM    2. This paper seeks HD DO\u2019s approval for the requirement specifications for the trial of the MMMM-Lite for two Frigates (FFSes).             OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  \n2  OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  SCOPE OF WORK AND CONTRACT V ALUE    3. Scope. The scope will include the hardware, software and support required for the Proof of Concept (PoC) trial of the MMMM-Lite on two FFSes.     4. Contract Value.  The estimated contract value of this trial will not exceed $205,000 (see the breakdown in Table 1).    Table 1: Cost Breakdown  S/N  Description  Estimated Cost  1  Hardware for 2 FFSes  $100,000  2  Software and Licenses for 2 FFSes  $15,000  3  IT man-effort and Professional Services  $90,000   Total  $205,000    5. Contract Duration. Contractor has up to 3 months to complete development, supply, installation, after which trial duration is for 30 days. After the trial, the findings will be evaluated through a report within 1 month before relevant RSN stakeholders decide if there is value to expand this to other ships.     6. Option for Scale-Up. The Supplier shall provide an option for proliferation should the PoC be successful in the form of supply and commission of additional ship-sets of MMMM-Lite. The scale up was shaped on a per ship basis with assumption of similar scale. The option shall be valid for 1 year after submission and acceptance of trial report. Each ship\u2019s installation shall be completed within 3 months of PO.  Maintenance on a per-ship basis shall also be quoted (starting after warranty expiry).    EV ALUATION METHODOLOGY    7. Evaluation will be based on the Contractor\u2019s ability to comply with the technical requirements stated in the requirement specifications and price reasonableness in comparison with existing market rates and past purchase prices. Quality (including innovation components) is not considered as the evaluation criteria as the nature of these buys is such that the quality is not differentiable and price is the primary consideration.      OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  \n3  OFFICIAL (CLOSED)      RECOMMENDATION     8. It is recommended that HD DO approves the requirement specifications and evaluation methodology for the PoC trial of the MMMM-Lite on two FFSes.

Requirement Specifications  OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  \nA-1 OFFICIAL (CLOSED)      ANNEX A    REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CREW MOBILE DIGITAL SERVICES LITE (MMMM-LITE) FOR FIRST FLOTILLA    GENERAL REQUIREMENT    1. Functional Requirements. The Supplier shall meet the following functional requirements for the implementation of MMMM-Lite for two FFSes.     a. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) of Logic-Based Gantry System. The PoC shall demonstrate the capability to determine the presence and the direction of movement of personnel through rule-based programming from RFID tag returns from several readers within FFS hangar. The system shall be able to accurately determine which direction the personnel is travelling towards through the computation of detection by respective readers placed at different exit points of the hangar.     b. PoC of Automated Safety Monitoring. The PoC shall demonstrate that when personnel enter the pre-determined out-of-bound compartment, the system notifies the Quartermaster (QM) via the Man-MachineInterface (MMI) that personnel have entered the compartment1.    c. Automated Attendance Tracking within Ship. The system shall be able to keep track of all ship crew entering or leaving ship and provide a MMI for ship\u2019s QM to monitor the real-time attendance onboard ship at any given time.    d. Digitised Attendance and Visitor Records. The system shall enable QMs to extract the attendance and visitor movement on and off ship over a 24-hour window. The system shall also provide data storage to keep up to 3 months of attendance and visitor records.    e. Other Operation Management Aids. User defined checklists, Duty Roster (including QM, HOTO, Occurrence, Rounds Logs, as well as QM details) and secure content repository shall be available and accessible.     1 Connectivity to this specific compartment if not within immediate vicinity, can be facilitated through powerline modems with RSN identifying a compartment on the same powerline circuit as the hangar  OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  \nA-2 OFFICIAL (CLOSED)  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRIAL OF MMMM-LITE      2. Technical Requirements. The Supplier shall meet the following technical requirements:    a. Hardware. The supplier shall supply all hardware required to meet the above functional requirements which includes but is not limited to (1) RFID sensors (and mounting brackets) and tags, (2) cables, (3) servers (in the form of desktop or laptops) for storage of attendance and visitor logs, (4) MMI for QMs to monitor and access data and (5) power-line modems.    b. Software. The Supplier shall supply the software required to run the program algorithm and also a User Interface (UI) for QM to access (1) realtime manpower movement, (2) Attendance and visitor records for up to 3 months and (3) notifications when personnel enters out-of-bound compartment.    3. Scope of PoC.     a. Demonstrate the ability to determine the presence of a personnel onboard ship through rule-based programming. The system shall be able to accurately determine which direction the personnel is travelling towards through the computation of detection by respective sensors placed at different exit points of the hangar.    b.
