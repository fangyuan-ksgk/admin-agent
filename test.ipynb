The document outlines the background, scope of work, contract value, technical requirements, and security requirements for this trial. The trial aims to automate crew and visitor tracking and provides a digitized management system for attendance and safety monitoring. The estimated contract value is $124,000, and if the Proof of Concept is successful, there is an option to scale up within a year.\n",
